The main differences between When2Meet and Doodle are that in Doodle, there's a "Maybe" option when choosing your availability whereas in When2Meet it's only a yes or a no. Also, in Doodle you can drag to show your availability over a time range, but in When2Meet you have to just select your availability in preset time slots set by the poll maker. 

Code was written by me, consulted https://github.com/JothiRamaswamy/CS279/tree/853564a3fbe69ec4d382bab3e6477702e32fe01f/t2%20doodle for help.
